::: justify
[3Vs](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0275037) (Vulnerability, Vaccination, and Values), is a framework devised to optimize the allocation of COVID-19 vaccines in settings characterized by resource constraints. The framework integrates processes of data collection, AI-facilitated vulnerability assessment, and vaccination prioritization, all aligned with the principles delineated by the World Health Organization (WHO). Noteworthy components encompass the compilation of socio-demographic and environmental data, AI-driven expert elicitation for prioritization, and geospatially informed vaccine allocation with due regard to equity values. The framework's empirical application in Kenya serves as a testament to its potential to surpass prevailing strategies, demonstrating adeptness in the judicious dispensation of vaccines to socially vulnerable demographics. Adaptable to diverse health emergencies, the 3Vs framework emerges as an invaluable instrument for decision-makers navigating challenges within resource-constrained environments.
