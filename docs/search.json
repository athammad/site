    "section": "",
    "text": "Logistic regression is a widely used statistical technique for modeling the relationship between a binary outcome and one or more predictor variables. It is commonly employed in various fields, such as healthcare, finance, and social sciences, to predict the probability of an event occurring. While the coefficients in logistic regression provide valuable insights, they are difficult to interpret. In this blog post, we will explore the use of marginal effects in logistic regression, unraveling their significance and practical applications.\n\n\nIn logistic regression, we model the log-odds of the event of interest occurring as a linear combination of predictor variables. The logistic function (sigmoid function) is then applied to this linear combination to convert it into a probability value between 0 and 1.\nThe logistic regression equation is given by:\n\\[\\text{logit}(P(Y=1)) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + ... + \\beta_pX_p\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(P(Y=1)\\) is the probability of the event of interest (e.g., success) occurring.\n\\(logit (P(Y=1))\\) is the log-odds (logit) of the event occurring.\n\\(\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\beta_2, ..., \\beta_p\\) are the coefficients of the model.\n\\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_p\\) are the predictor variables.\n\n\n\nThe coefficients \\(\\beta_1, \\beta_2, ..., \\beta_p\\) in the logistic regression equation hold crucial information about the impact of each predictor variable on the log-odds of the event occurring. To interpret these coefficients, we need to consider their signs, magnitude, and statistical significance.\n\nSign of Coefficients:\n\nThe sign of a coefficient reveals the direction of the relationship between the predictor variable and the log-odds of the event occurring. A positive coefficient (\\(\\beta &gt; 0\\)) indicates that an increase in the predictor variable leads to an increase in the log-odds (probability) of the event happening. Conversely, a negative coefficient (\\(\\beta &lt; 0\\)) suggests that an increase in the predictor variable is associated with a decrease in the log-odds (probability) of the event occurring.\n\nMagnitude of Coefficients:\n\nThe magnitude of a coefficient provides information about the strength of the relationship between the predictor variable and the log-odds of the event. Larger absolute values of coefficients indicate stronger influences on the probability.\n\nStatistical Significance:\n\nEvaluating the statistical significance of coefficients is essential to determine if the relationship between a predictor variable and the event probability is meaningful or just due to random chance. Researchers often use hypothesis testing or confidence intervals to assess the statistical significance of coefficients.\n\n\nLet’s consider an example to illustrate the interpretation of coefficients in logistic regression. Suppose we are studying the factors that influence whether a customer will make a purchase on an e-commerce website. Our logistic regression model includes two predictor variables: “Time Spent on Website” and “Number of Items Added to Cart.” The estimated coefficients are as follows:\n\n\\(\\beta_{\\text{Time Spent}} = 0.05\\)\n\\(\\beta_{\\text{Number of Items}} = 0.2\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\beta_{\\text{Time Spent}} = 0.05\\): For each additional minute a customer spends on the website, the log-odds (probability) of making a purchase increases by 0.05 units. This means that spending more time on the website is associated with a higher likelihood of making a purchase.\n\\(\\beta_{\\text{Number of Items}} = 0.2\\): For each additional item a customer adds to the cart, the log-odds (probability) of making a purchase increases by 0.2 units. This suggests that adding more items to the cart is associated with a higher probability of making a purchase.\n\n\n\n\nIdeally, we want to understand what the model is telling us on the probability scale and not in the odds scale, much less in the estimation scale, the log-odds.\nWe might be tempted to convert log-odds to odds and then to probability and interpret everything as usual. But this would be very wrong!\nWhy?\nThe issue here is that on the probability scale the function is non-linear!\n\n\n\n\nMarginal effects can be described as the change in outcome as a function of the change in the independent variable of interest holding all other variables in the model constant.\n\nNOTE: In linear regression, the estimated regression coefficients are marginal effects and are more easily interpreted.*\n\nOne measure of change in a system is that the rate of change of the system is non-zero.\nIf we had a simple linear regression model for a trend, then the estimated rate of change would be the slope of the line. Technically, this is the instantaneous rate of change of the function that defines the line.\nThe idea can be extended to any function, even one as potentially complex non-linear function.\nThe problem we have is that in general we don’t have an equation for the non-linear from which we can derive the derivatives.\nSo how do we estimate the derivative of a non-linear function ?\nOne solution is to use the method of finite differences but to understand it properly we need to introduce first the basic concept of differential calculus.\n\n\n\n\nDifferential calculus is a branch of calculus that focuses on the study of rates of change and slopes of curves. It deals with the concept of derivatives, which represent the rate of change of a function at a specific point. Derivatives allow us to understand how a function is changing at a particular location and provide valuable insights into the behavior of functions.\nThe derivative of a function \\(f(x)\\) with respect to \\(x\\) is denoted as \\(f'(x)\\) or \\(\\frac{df(x)}{dx}\\). It represents the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at a given point \\(x\\). The derivative can be interpreted as the instantaneous rate of change of \\(f(x)\\) with respect to \\(x\\).\nFor example, consider the function \\(f(x) = x^2\\). The derivative of \\(f(x)\\) is \\(f'(x) = 2x\\). This means that the slope of the tangent line to the graph of \\(f(x)\\) at any point \\(x\\) is twice the value of \\(x\\) at that point.\nDifferential calculus has wide-ranging applications in various fields, including physics, engineering, economics, and more. It is used to model and analyze phenomena that involve continuous changes, such as motion, growth, and optimization.\nFinite differences are a numerical technique used to approximate derivatives of functions. The method involves computing the difference in function values at two nearby points and then dividing by the difference in their corresponding independent variable values. By using a small interval between the two points, we can get an approximation of the derivative at a specific point.\nThe finite difference formula for approximating the first derivative of a function \\(f(x)\\) at a point \\(x\\) is given by:\n\\[ f’(x) \\approx \\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} \\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(h\\) is a small value representing the step size or interval between the points.\n\nSimilarly, we can use finite differences to approximate higher-order derivatives, such as the second derivative:\n\\[ f’’(x) \\approx \\frac{f(x + h) - 2f(x) + f(x - h)}{h^2} \\]\nFinite differences are particularly useful when the analytical expression for the derivative is difficult to obtain or when dealing with discrete data points instead of continuous functions.\nDifferential calculus and finite differences are both essential tools in mathematics and scientific disciplines. Differential calculus provides a rigorous framework for studying rates of change and slopes of curves through derivatives. On the other hand, finite differences offer a practical and numerical approach to approximate derivatives when the analytical solution is not readily available or when dealing with discrete data. Together, these concepts enable us to better understand the behavior of functions and analyze real-world phenomena involving continuous and discrete changes.\n\n\n\nIn logistic regression, the estimated coefficients (log odds) indicate how the log odds of the outcome change with a one-unit increase in the predictor variable while holding other variables constant. However, interpreting these coefficients can be challenging, especially for non-statisticians. This is where marginal effects come to the rescue.\nMarginal effects provide a more straightforward interpretation by measuring the impact of a one-unit change in the predictor variable on the probability of the event occurring (i.e., the probability of success). They express the change in the probability as a result of the predictor variable’s change, allowing us to understand the practical implications of the model."

    "text": "Hey fellow data enthusiasts! Today, let’s embark on a journey to explore the captivating world of causal machine learning. 🚀\n🔍 Understanding Causality:\nIn the realm of traditional machine learning, we primarily focus on identifying patterns and correlations in data to make accurate predictions. While this approach is incredibly useful, it often fails to decipher the cause-and-effect relationships that underpin these patterns. This limitation can lead to misguided conclusions and ineffective decision-making.\nCausality seeks to answer “why” questions, revealing the cause behind an observed effect. Imagine a scenario where we want to understand if a certain medication truly improves patient outcomes or if it’s just correlated with better health. Causal inference allows us to make more meaningful inferences, beyond mere correlations.\n🧩 The Challenge of Causal Inference:\nEstablishing causality is not a straightforward task. The fundamental problem lies in the fact that we cannot simultaneously observe both the treatment group (those who receive a particular intervention) and the control group (those who do not). Traditional observational data often suffers from confounding variables, making it challenging to disentangle cause and effect.\n💡 Enter Causal Machine Learning:\nCausal Machine Learning, a fascinating interdisciplinary field, bridges the gap between traditional machine learning and causal inference. Its primary goal is to leverage data to identify causal relationships and infer the effects of interventions accurately.\n🎯 Causal Inference Methods:\n1. Randomized Control Trials (RCTs): Considered the gold standard for establishing causality, RCTs involve randomly assigning subjects to either the treatment or control group. By eliminating confounding factors, RCTs provide strong causal evidence. However, they may not always be practical or ethical.\n2. Propensity Score Matching (PSM): When RCTs are not feasible, PSM is a popular method. It attempts to create a “quasi-experimental” design by matching treated and control units based on their propensity scores, which represent the likelihood of receiving the treatment.

    "text": "Quantile Random Forest (QRF) is an extension of the traditional Random Forest algorithm that estimates not only the mean but also the entire conditional distribution of the target variable. The distribution is represented by its quantiles, which are specific points that divide the data into segments, such as quartiles (0.25, 0.50, 0.75). QRF is particularly useful when dealing with heteroscedastic data or when we need to assess the uncertainty in our predictions beyond just the central tendency.\nIn QRF, an ensemble of decision trees is constructed. Each decision tree is built by bootstrapping the training data, which means sampling the data points with replacement, and selecting a random subset of features at each split. This creates diversity among the trees in the ensemble.\nThe key difference between Random Forest and QRF lies in the prediction phase. In Random Forest, the predicted value for a new data point is the average (mean) of the individual tree predictions. However, in QRF, we aim to estimate multiple quantiles of the target variable’s distribution for a given input.\nWhen growing a tree in QRF, instead of splitting the data based solely on minimizing the variance or mean squared error, QRF performs splits to optimize quantile-specific criteria. Each tree node is split to minimize the quantile loss function, which reflects the error in predicting the specific quantile. This means that the tree seeks to minimize the difference between the true quantile value and the estimated quantile value for the data points that fall into each node.\nOnce the tree is fully grown, the terminal nodes (leaf nodes) contain specific quantile values rather than just the average value. Each terminal node in the QRF stores a quantile-specific estimate based on the data points that fall into that node. This means that each tree provides quantile-specific predictions.\nTo make predictions for a new data point, QRF evaluates the input through each decision tree, resulting in a set of quantile-specific predictions. The user can then choose the desired quantiles (e.g., 0.25, 0.50, 0.75) to obtain the corresponding quantile predictions. For example, if we want to estimate the 0.75 quantile, we collect the 0.75 quantile values from each tree, and these values form the quantile prediction for that data point.\nOne of the advantages of QRF is that it provides a measure of uncertainty in the predictions. Given the estimated quantiles, QRF can construct a prediction interval for each data point. The prediction interval provides a range of possible values, accounting for the uncertainty in the prediction due to the variability of the underlying data.\nAdvantages of Quantile Random Forest:\n\nRobustness to outliers: QRF can handle outliers effectively as it estimates the entire distribution, including extreme quantiles.\nProvides uncertainty information: By estimating quantiles, QRF offers a measure of uncertainty in the predictions, which is valuable in decision-making.\nVersatility: QRF can be applied to regression and quantile regression problems, and it can be extended to handle multivariate quantile estimation.\n\nApplications of Quantile Random Forest:\n\nFinancial forecasting: QRF can be used to predict quantiles of financial variables, such as stock prices or asset returns, to assess the risk of investment decisions.\nMedical applications: In healthcare, QRF can estimate quantiles of patient response times to treatments, enabling doctors to tailor treatments accordingly.\nEnvironmental modeling: QRF can estimate quantiles of environmental variables like pollutant concentrations, assisting in environmental risk assessments.\n\nIn summary, Quantile Random Forest is a powerful extension of the Random Forest algorithm that estimates the entire distribution of the target variable through quantile-specific predictions. It is useful when capturing the entire distribution or quantifying uncertainty is essential for making informed decisions in various applications such as finance, healthcare, and environmental modeling."

    "text": "Title: Embracing Change: Incremental vs. Batch Machine Learning\nIntroduction\nMachine learning has revolutionized the way we interact with data, allowing us to uncover valuable insights and make informed decisions. Within the realm of machine learning, there are two fundamental approaches: incremental learning and batch learning. These methods serve distinct purposes and cater to diverse scenarios, offering unique advantages and challenges. In this blog post, we will embark on an exciting journey to understand the differences between incremental and batch machine learning, providing you with the knowledge to embrace these powerful techniques.\nIncremental Machine Learning: An Ever-Evolving Journey\nImagine a learning process that continuously adapts to new information, always striving to stay up-to-date with the latest trends. That’s incremental machine learning for you! Also known as online learning or streaming learning, this approach updates the model in real-time as fresh data arrives. Unlike batch learning, which requires processing the entire dataset at once, incremental learning embraces change, incorporating new observations into the existing model as they arrive.\nCharacteristics of Incremental Machine Learning:\n1. Real-Time Adaptation: The beauty of incremental learning lies in its ability to quickly respond to shifts in data distribution. This makes it ideal for applications dealing with rapidly evolving data, like online advertising or fraud detection.\n2. Low Memory Requirements: Incremental learning processes data in small batches or individual data points, reducing memory usage compared to batch learning, where the entire dataset needs to be stored.\n3. Constant Learning: With incremental learning, models can continuously learn and improve over time without the need for retraining on the entire dataset. It’s like a lifelong learning journey!\nAdvantages of Incremental Machine Learning:\n1. Efficiency: Incremental learning is computationally efficient since it updates the model incrementally, without the need to retrain on the entire dataset each time.\n2. Scalability: This approach is well-suited for large-scale applications where processing the entire dataset at once would be overwhelming.\n3. Dynamic Adaptation: Incremental learning is ideal for applications where data distribution changes frequently, such as natural language processing or recommendation systems. It embraces the unexpected!\nDisadvantages of Incremental Machine Learning:\n1. Forgetting Old Data: Just like we can’t remember everything we’ve learned in the past, incremental learning models may forget information from the past, leading to potential performance degradation on older data points.\n2. Model Drift: In dynamic environments, incremental learning models may struggle to adapt to sudden shifts in data patterns, leading to inaccuracies. Sometimes, change can be overwhelming!\nBatch Machine Learning: A Journey with Stability\nNow, let’s switch gears and explore batch machine learning. Picture a learning process that takes time to analyze and understand the whole story before making decisions. That’s batch machine learning for you! This approach involves training the model on the entire dataset and updating it periodically or when significant amounts of new data accumulate.\nCharacteristics of Batch Machine Learning:\n1. Periodic Updates: Batch learning involves training models from scratch on a fixed dataset, leveraging powerful hardware resources and sophisticated algorithms. It’s like taking a step back to see the bigger picture!\n2. Complete Data Usage: Unlike incremental learning, which processes data in smaller chunks, batch learning uses the entire dataset for training, ensuring no data points are left behind.\nAdvantages of Batch Machine Learning:\n1. Strong Convergence: By training on the entire dataset, batch learning often achieves more stable and reliable results, especially with sufficient computational resources. It’s like taking the time to contemplate before making decisions.\n2. Accuracy: Batch learning models tend to be more accurate due to their exhaustive training process. Sometimes, thoroughness pays off!\nDisadvantages of Batch Machine Learning:\n1. High Resource Demands: Batch learning requires substantial computational power and memory, making it less scalable for real-time applications or large datasets.\n2. Time Lag in Updates: Models may not adapt quickly to changes in data distribution since they are updated only after accumulating new data. Patience is key!\nUse Cases for Incremental and Batch Machine Learning\nIncremental Learning:\n- Real-time fraud detection in financial transactions.\n- Adaptive recommendation systems that learn from user interactions in real-time.\n- Sentiment analysis on streaming social media data.\nBatch Learning:\n- Image classification in computer vision tasks.\n- Natural language processing applications like language translation.\n- Training large-scale recommendation systems periodically.\nConclusion\nAs we bid farewell to this exploration, we have gained an understanding of the intriguing differences between incremental and batch machine learning. Incremental learning embraces change and adapts to evolving data, making it perfect for real-time applications. On the other hand, batch learning takes a more measured approach, achieving strong convergence and accuracy with thorough analysis. Both methods have their unique strengths, empowering data scientists and developers to make informed choices based on the demands of their applications. So, whether you’re venturing on a dynamic journey with incremental learning or taking a stable path with batch learning, remember to embrace the wonders of machine learning and let it lead you to exciting discoveries!"

A positive coefficient (\\(\\beta &gt; 0\\)) indicates that an increase in the predictor variable leads to an increase in the log-odds (probability) of the event happening.

Researchers often use hypothesis testing or confidence intervals to assess the statistical significance of coefficients.\nPractical Interpretation Example\nLet’s consider an example to illustrate the interpretation of coefficients in logistic regression. Suppose we are studying the factors that influence whether a customer will make a purchase on an e-commerce website. Our logistic regression model includes two predictor variables: “Time Spent on Website” and “Number of Items Added to Cart.” The estimated coefficients are as follows:\n\n\\(\\beta_{\\text{Time Spent}} = 0.05\\)\n\\(\\beta_{\\text{Number of Items}} = 0.2\\)"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In the realm of traditional machine learning, we primarily focus on identifying patterns and correlations in data to make accurate predictions. While this approach is incredibly useful, it often fails to decipher the cause-and-effect relationships that underpin these patterns. This limitation can lead to misguided conclusions and ineffective decision-making.\nCausality seeks to answer “why” questions, revealing the cause behind an observed effect. Imagine a scenario where we want to understand if a certain medication truly improves patient outcomes or if it’s just correlated with better health. Causal inference allows us to make more meaningful inferences, beyond mere correlations.\n\n\nEstablishing causality is not a straightforward task. The fundamental problem lies in the fact that we cannot simultaneously observe both the treatment group (those who receive a particular intervention) and the control group (those who do not). Traditional observational data often suffers from confounding variables, making it challenging to disentangle cause and effect.\n\n\n\nCausal Machine Learning, a fascinating interdisciplinary field, bridges the gap between traditional machine learning and causal inference. Its primary goal is to leverage data to identify causal relationships and infer the effects of interventions accurately.\n\n\n\n\nRandomized Control Trials (RCTs): Considered the gold standard for establishing causality, RCTs involve randomly assigning subjects to either the treatment or control group. By eliminating confounding factors, RCTs provide strong causal evidence. However, they may not always be practical or ethical.\nPropensity Score Matching (PSM): When RCTs are not feasible, PSM is a popular method. It attempts to create a “quasi-experimental” design by matching treated and control units based on their propensity scores, which represent the likelihood of receiving the treatment. This helps mitigate confounding effects.\nInstrumental Variables (IV): IV analysis relies on instrumental variables that are correlated with the treatment but have no direct effect on the outcome.

Also known as online learning or streaming learning, this approach updates the model in real-time as fresh data arrives. Unlike batch learning, which requires processing the entire dataset at once, incremental learning embraces change, incorporating new observations into the existing model as they arrive.\n\n\n\nReal-Time Adaptation: The beauty of incremental learning lies in its ability to quickly respond to shifts in data distribution. This makes it ideal for applications dealing with rapidly evolving data, like online advertising or fraud detection.\nLow Memory Requirements: Incremental learning processes data in small batches or individual data points, reducing memory usage compared to batch learning, where the entire dataset needs to be stored.\nConstant Learning: With incremental learning, models can continuously learn and improve over time without the need for retraining on the entire dataset. It’s like a lifelong learning journey!\n\nAdvantages of Incremental Machine Learning\n\nEfficiency: Incremental learning is computationally efficient since it updates the model incrementally, without the need to retrain on the entire dataset each time.\nScalability: This approach is well-suited for large-scale applications where processing the entire dataset at once would be overwhelming.\nDynamic Adaptation: Incremental learning is ideal for applications where data distribution changes frequently, such as natural language processing or recommendation systems. It embraces the unexpected!\n\nDisadvantages of Incremental Machine Learning\n\nForgetting Old Data: Just like we can’t remember everything we’ve learned in the past, incremental learning models may forget information from the past, leading to potential performance degradation on older data points.\nModel Drift: In dynamic environments, incremental learning models may struggle to adapt to sudden shifts in data patterns, leading to inaccuracies.

By eliminating confounding factors, RCTs provide strong causal evidence. However, they may not always be practical or ethical.\nPropensity Score Matching (PSM): When RCTs are not feasible, PSM is a popular method. It attempts to create a “quasi-experimental” design by matching treated and control units based on their propensity scores, which represent the likelihood of receiving the treatment. This helps mitigate confounding effects.\nInstrumental Variables (IV): IV analysis relies on instrumental variables that are correlated with the treatment but have no direct effect on the outcome. By utilizing these instruments, researchers can uncover causal relationships even in the presence of unobserved confounders.\nSynthetic Control (SC): The process of creating a synthetic counterfactual involves using historical data from similar individuals or groups that did not receive the treatment to construct a “synthetic” control group. This control group is designed to closely match the characteristics of the treated group before the intervention. By doing so, researchers aim to create a plausible estimate of what would have happened to the treated group had they not received the treatment."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The key difference between Random Forest and QRF lies in the prediction phase. In Random Forest, the predicted value for a new data point is the average (mean) of the individual tree predictions. However, in QRF, we aim to estimate multiple quantiles of the target variable’s distribution for a given input.\nWhen growing a tree in QRF, instead of splitting the data based solely on minimizing the variance or mean squared error, QRF performs splits to optimize quantile-specific criteria. Each tree node is split to minimize the quantile loss function, which reflects the error in predicting the specific quantile. This means that the tree seeks to minimize the difference between the true quantile value and the estimated quantile value for the data points that fall into each node.\nOnce the tree is fully grown, the terminal nodes (leaf nodes) contain specific quantile values rather than just the average value. Each terminal node in the QRF stores a quantile-specific estimate based on the data points that fall into that node. This means that each tree provides quantile-specific predictions.\nTo make predictions for a new data point, QRF evaluates the input through each decision tree, resulting in a set of quantile-specific predictions. The user can then choose the desired quantiles (e.g., 0.25, 0.50, 0.75) to obtain the corresponding quantile predictions. For example, if we want to estimate the 0.75 quantile, we collect the 0.75 quantile values from each tree, and these values form the quantile prediction for that data point.\nOne of the advantages of QRF is that it provides a measure of uncertainty in the predictions. Given the estimated quantiles, QRF can construct a prediction interval for each data point. The prediction interval provides a range of possible values, accounting for the uncertainty in the prediction due to the variability of the underlying data."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Imagine a gambler facing a row of slot machines (arms), each with an unknown payout probability. The gambler’s goal is to maximize their cumulative reward while exploring the machines’ potential and exploiting the most promising ones. In recent years, the contextual multi-armed bandit (CMAB) has emerged as a powerful extension to this problem, incorporating context or additional information to make even more intelligent decisions. In this blog post, we will delve into the world of contextual multi-armed bandits, exploring their significance, strategies, and real-world applications.\n\n\nIn the classic multi-armed bandit problem, a gambler is faced with a set of arms (slot machines) that have different reward probabilities, but the gambler doesn’t know these probabilities initially. The gambler’s objective is to determine which arms to pull (explore) and which to favor (exploit) over time to maximize their cumulative reward. The challenge lies in striking a balance between exploring new arms to gather more information and exploiting the arms that seem to provide higher rewards.\n\n\n\nThe contextual multi-armed bandit takes the classic problem a step further by incorporating additional information or context. In CMAB, each arm is associated with a context, which can be thought of as features or attributes characterizing the current situation. This context provides valuable insights into the arms’ potential rewards and helps the decision-maker make more informed choices.\nFor instance, imagine a digital advertising scenario where ads (arms) are shown to users, and each ad has associated user characteristics as context, such as age, location, and interests. By considering the context, the CMAB algorithm can optimize the selection of ads for each user to maximize clicks or conversions.\n\n\n\nLinUCB Algorithm:\n\nOne popular approach for solving CMAB problems is the LinUCB algorithm. It uses linear models to estimate the expected rewards for each arm given the context. The algorithm maintains a confidence interval for each arm’s expected reward and selects the arm with the highest upper confidence bound, balancing exploration and exploitation.\n\nThompson Sampling:\n\nThompson Sampling is a widely used Bayesian approach for CMAB. It models the reward distribution for each arm based on observed rewards and context. The algorithm then samples from these distributions and selects the arm with the highest sample. This method effectively leverages uncertainty to explore and exploit in a principled manner.\nReal-World Applications of Contextual Multi-Armed Bandits\n\nPersonalized Recommendations:\n\nCMAB algorithms can be applied to personalized recommendation systems, where the context represents user preferences, past behavior, and demographics. By dynamically selecting the most relevant content or products, these systems can improve user engagement and satisfaction.\n\nHealthcare Treatment Selection:\n\nIn healthcare, CMAB can help optimize treatment selection based on patient characteristics, medical history, and response to previous treatments. By considering the context, doctors can make more data-driven decisions to improve patient outcomes.\n\nOnline Advertising:\n\nIn digital advertising, CMAB can enhance ad placement by taking into account user profiles, browsing behavior, and real-time context. This enables advertisers to show the most relevant ads to users, increasing click-through rates and conversions."

In such cases, traditional probabilistic models may not be sufficient to capture the full extent of uncertainty.\nDeep uncertainty is particularly prevalent in complex and chaotic systems, where there are many interacting variables and non-linear relationships that are difficult to model precisely. In these scenarios, traditional probabilistic models may yield unreliable estimates or may not provide meaningful uncertainty quantification.\nTo address deep uncertainty, researchers have developed alternative methods, such as robust optimization, scenario-based analysis, and Bayesian non-parametric models. These techniques are designed to handle situations where the underlying assumptions are uncertain or where we lack sufficient data to make accurate probabilistic estimates.\nIn recent years, the development of deep learning and Bayesian deep learning has also allowed us to tackle deep uncertainty in more complex models. Bayesian neural networks, for example, use Bayesian inference to represent uncertainty in neural network weights, enabling better uncertainty quantification in deep learning models."

    "text": "Finite differences\nDifferential calculus is a branch of calculus that focuses on the study of rates of change and slopes of curves. It deals with the concept of derivatives, which represent the rate of change of a function at a specific point. Derivatives allow us to understand how a function is changing at a particular location and provide valuable insights into the behavior of functions.\nThe derivative of a function \\(f(x)\\) with respect to \\(x\\) is denoted as \\(f'(x)\\) or \\(\\frac{df(x)}{dx}\\). It represents the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at a given point \\(x\\). The derivative can be interpreted as the instantaneous rate of change of \\(f(x)\\) with respect to \\(x\\).\nFor example, consider the function \\(f(x) = x^2\\). The derivative of \\(f(x)\\) is \\(f'(x) = 2x\\). This means that the slope of the tangent line to the graph of \\(f(x)\\) at any point \\(x\\) is twice the value of \\(x\\) at that point.\nDifferential calculus has wide-ranging applications in various fields, including physics, engineering, economics, and more. It is used to model and analyze phenomena that involve continuous changes, such as motion, growth, and optimization.\nFinite differences are a numerical technique used to approximate derivatives of functions. The method involves computing the difference in function values at two nearby points and then dividing by the difference in their corresponding independent variable values. By using a small interval between the two points, we can get an approximation of the derivative at a specific point.\nThe finite difference formula for approximating the first derivative of a function \\(f(x)\\) at a point \\(x\\) is given by:\n\\[ f’(x) \\approx \\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} \\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(h\\) is a small value representing the step size or interval between the points.\n\nSimilarly, we can use finite differences to approximate higher-order derivatives, such as the second derivative:\n\\[ f’’(x) \\approx \\frac{f(x + h) - 2f(x) + f(x - h)}{h^2} \\]\nFinite differences are particularly useful when the analytical expression for the derivative is difficult to obtain or when dealing with discrete data points instead of continuous functions.\nDifferential calculus and finite differences are both essential tools in mathematics and scientific disciplines. Differential calculus provides a rigorous framework for studying rates of change and slopes of curves through derivatives. On the other hand, finite differences offer a practical and numerical approach to approximate derivatives when the analytical solution is not readily available or when dealing with discrete data. Together, these concepts enable us to better understand the behavior of functions and analyze real-world phenomena involving continuous and discrete changes."

    "text": "Developing within a Docker container has become a common practice in the software development workflow. It offers various benefits, such as ensuring consistent environments, reproducibility, and isolation.\nUsing docker means not having to have complex software server applications installed locally. Instead, they are run in ‘sealed’ containers, held discrete from the local computer. In an example Use Case of developing code in Python, for example, a docker container holding the latest version of Python, plus the Python script can be built and run. However, in this use case, to edit the Python script and rerun it, the image container needs to be rebuilt in docker each time there are changes made to the code. Docker can use ‘bind mounts’ to circumvent this for development purposes. The folder holding the source code is ‘mounted’ into the container image, meaning that the source code can then be edited and run immediately in the image without needing to be rebuilt.\nCombining Docker with a bind mount in VScode makes life so much easier. Here’s a step-by-step guide to get started with developing in a Docker container:\n\nInstall Docker: Make sure you have Docker installed on your system. You can download and install it from the official Docker website based on your operating system. 2. Create a Dockerfile: A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. Create a new file named Dockerfile in your project’s root directory. Here’s a basic example of a Python project:\n\n# Use an official Python runtime as the base image\nFROM python:3.10.6-buster\n\nCOPY requirements.txt /requirements.txt\n\nRUN pip install --upgrade pip RUN pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n# Set the working directory\n\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Define the command to run when the container starts\n\nCMD \\[\"bash\"\\]\n\nBuild the Docker Image: Open a terminal, navigate to your project’s directory containing the Dockerfile, and run the following command to build the Docker image:\n\ndocker build -t myapp .\nHere, myapp is the name you’re giving to your Docker image, and the dot . indicates the build context (current directory).\n\nRun the Docker Container: After building the image, you can run a container from it using the following command:\n\ndocker run -d -it --hostname yourname -v /path/to/folder/holding/the/source/code:/app myapp\nHere, -d runs the container in detached mode, -it allocates a pseudo-TTY and keeps STDIN open even if not attached, -- hostname simply indicates the container’s hostname , finally -v will bind mount a volume following given its path.\n\nConnect with VScode: Now that you have your development environment inside a Docker container, you can edit your code directly inside the container using VScode. Changes you make to your code will be reflected within the container. This way, you can edit code on your host machine and see the changes in the container immediately.\nTo do so, you will need to install the docker extension as shown below.\n\n\nOnce you have installed the extension, go on the docker icon in the left side bar and this is what you will see.\n\nAnd here is the app folder inside the container.\n\nFinally you just need to right click on the container and you will see th option to Attach Visual Studio Code. This will open a new VScode window. Now you are inside the container you can start to develop. All changes you will made to the files in the attached folder will affect the local folder as well."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A data science boilerplate, in the context of software development and data science projects, refers to a standardized and reusable set of code, templates, libraries, and best practices that are pre-defined and organized to kickstart a data science project. It serves as a foundation or starting point for data scientists and analysts, helping them save time and effort when beginning a new project or analysis. Here’s an ideal data science boilerplate that I recommend for basically any project.\n\nThe folder structure\n.\n├── data\n│   └── data.csv\n├── Dockerfile\n├── Makefile\n├── .env\n├──.envrc\n├── .gitignore\n├── notebooks\n│   └── datascientist_deliverable.ipynb\n├── README.md\n├── requirements.txt\n├── scripts\n│   └── script.py\n├── setup.py\n└── thepkg\n    ├── __init__.py\n    ├── interface\n    │   └── __init__.py\n    ├── ml_logic\n    │   ├── data.py\n    │   ├── __init__.py\n    │   ├── model.py\n    │   └── preprocessor.py\n    ├── params.py\n    └── utils.py\n\nThis folder structure represents a typical directory layout for a data science project. Each folder and file serves a specific purpose in organizing and managing the project’s code, data, documentation, and other resources. I will now give an explanation of each item in the structure:\n\ndata: This folder contains the project’s data files. In this case, there is a single CSV file named data.csv, but you can add more data files as needed.\nDockerfile: This file is used to define the instructions for creating a Docker container for your project. Docker allows you to encapsulate your project environment and dependencies for consistency and portability. This is a key element for most of my projects since I love to delevope inside a Docker Container (see my other blog post on how to use Docker with ‘bind mounts’.)\nMakefile: A Makefile contains a set of rules and commands for building, testing, and running various aspects of your project. It can automate common development tasks.\n.env: This file is often used to store environment variables specific to your project. These variables can include API keys, database connection strings, or other sensitive information.\n.envrc: This file is typically used in conjunction with a tool like direnv to manage environment variables for your project, ensuring that the correct environment is set up when you enter the project directory.\n.gitignore: This file specifies files and folders that should be ignored by Git when tracking changes. It helps avoid including sensitive or unnecessary files in version control.\nnotebooks: This folder is meant for Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, analysis, and documentation. In this case, there’s a single notebook file named datascientist_deliverable.ipynb.\nREADME.md: This Markdown file is used to provide an overview and documentation of the project. It typically includes project goals, setup instructions, usage examples, and other relevant information.\nrequirements.txt: This file lists the Python packages and their versions required for the project. You can use it to recreate the project’s environment on another system.\nscripts: This folder is intended for Python scripts that are part of your project. In this example, there’s a single script file named script.py.\nsetup.py: This is a Python script used for packaging and distributing your project as a Python package and is directly related with the folder `thepkg`. It’s often used when you want to share your code with others or publish it on platforms like PyPI.\nthepkg: This folder represents the main Python package of your project. In development phase we would install the package using the classic pip install . e (editablemode) to updated function without having to reinstalling it over and over again. The folder is organized in a way that follows Python package conventions:\n\ninit.py: These files indicate that the directories are Python packages and can be imported as modules.\ninterface: This subpackage appears to be a module for defining an interface or API for your project.\nml_logic: This subpackage seems to contain modules related to machine learning logic, including data processing (data.py and preprocessor.py) and modeling (model.py).\nparams.py: This file could contain project-specific configuration parameters or settings.\nutils.py: This file likely contains utility functions or helper code used throughout the project.\n\n\nOverall, this folder structure provides a well-organized framework for a data science project, making it easier to collaborate, manage dependencies, and maintain consistency in your work.\nRemember that I boilerplate is just a template. Feel free to use this structure as a first step into your new Data Science project."

    "section": "",
    "text": "To elucidate the workings of Bayesian updating, I often find it helpful to draw parallels from everyday experiences. Previously, I’ve used examples like my dog and my first date with my girlfriend. This time, let’s delve into the concept using a job interview scenario.\n\n\nImagine you’ve landed a job interview – you’re simultaneously excited and apprehensive. As you stand at the threshold, you’re completely uncertain about what awaits you inside. You don’t know who the interviewers are, what to expect, or how the interview will unfold. The odds of everything going either terribly wrong or wonderfully right seem equally plausible.\nIn the realm of probability, we can liken your state of mind to a uniform distribution, where all outcomes are equally probable. This state of not knowing what will happen or how the interview will conclude is what Bayesian terminology dubs the “prior belief” – it’s the starting point for your assessment.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport scipy.stats as stats\n\n#make this example reproducible.\nnp.random.seed(1)\ndataUni = np.random.uniform(size=1000)\nsns.kdeplot(dataUni)\n# Adjust x-axis limits to show the tails\nplt.xlim(-0.1, 1.1)\nplt.title('Prior Belief with no idea')\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, we still call it a “prior belief” even if you harbor some inkling about how the interview might unfold. For instance, let’s say you had an unpleasant preliminary conversation with the company, and as you enter the room, you’re not filled with optimism, estimating a 40% chance of success. In Bayesian terms, this, too, can be translated into probabilities.\n\n\nCode\n#make this example reproducible.\nnp.random.seed(1)\n# Define the parameters for the prior belief and evidence\nprior_prob = 0.4\n# Create a range of values for the probability (x-axis)\nx = np.linspace(0, 1, 1000)\n# Calculate the prior probability distribution (prior belief)\nprior_distribution = stats.beta.pdf(x, 2, 3)  # Beta distribution parameters (2, 3)\nsns.lineplot(x=x, y=prior_distribution,color=\"blue\")\nplt.title('Prior Belief with some idea')\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep in mind, though, that this assessment is occurring just as you’re about to step through the door.\n\n\n\nNow, envision yourself crossing that threshold, and the interviewers pose their initial question. Your response is swift, and you notice a confident smile on the interviewer’s face. This moment represents a pivotal piece of new information drawn from your real-time experience, and naturally, you’ll use it to revise your initial belief about the interview’s outcome. We call this new information and “evidence”.\nWhat’s happening inside your mind, that surge of heightened confidence, can once again be translated into numerical probabilities to update your initial belief. This is precisely where the Bayes comes into play.\nLet’s show how the update takes place. Let’s assign to that smile, the evidence, a probability of 80% to pass the interview.\n\n\nCode\nevidence_prob = 0.8\n# Create a range of values for the probability (x-axis)\nx = np.linspace(0, 1, 1000)\n\nevidence_distribution = stats.beta.pdf(x, 4, 2)  # Beta distribution parameters (4, 2)\nsns.lineplot(x=x, y=evidence_distribution, color='green')\nplt.title('Evidence')\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let’s plug in all the information we have in the Bayesian therm we all know. We started with a not so confident prior belief (40% chance of success), then we got a new smiling evidence (80% chance of success). From here we can combine these two information and calculate our updated beliefs or as we call them “posterior beliefs”.\n\n\nCode\n# Define the parameters for the prior belief and evidence\nprior_prob = 0.4\nevidence_prob = 0.8\n\n# Create a range of values for the probability (x-axis)\nx = np.linspace(0, 1, 1000)\n\n# Calculate the prior probability distribution (prior belief)\nprior_distribution = stats.beta.pdf(x, 2, 3)  # Beta distribution parameters (2, 3)\n\n# Calculate the evidence (as a Beta distribution with parameters based on evidence probability)\nevidence_distribution = stats.beta.pdf(x, 4, 2)  # Beta distribution parameters (4, 2)\n\n# Calculate the posterior probability distribution (updated belief)\nposterior_distribution = prior_distribution * evidence_distribution\nposterior_distribution = posterior_distribution\n\n# Create a Seaborn plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.lineplot(x=x, y=prior_distribution, label='Prior Belief (40%)', color='blue')\nsns.lineplot(x=x, y=evidence_distribution, label='Evidence (80%)', color='green')\nsns.lineplot(x=x, y=posterior_distribution, label='Posterior Belief', color='red')\n\n# Customize the plot\nplt.title('Bayes update Representation')\nplt.xlabel('Probability')\nplt.ylabel('Density')\nplt.legend()\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, now you have around 60% of passing the interview. These process can keep on going with every new information you collect during the interview as in this gif.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn essence, this is the core of Bayesian updating. It allows you to adapt your beliefs based on new information as you progress through an uncertain situation, much like navigating the twists and turns of a job interview."

    "text": "Now, envision yourself crossing that threshold, and the interviewers pose their initial question. Your response is swift, and you notice a confident smile on the interviewer’s face. This moment represents a pivotal piece of new information drawn from your real-time experience, and naturally, you’ll use it to revise your initial belief about the interview’s outcome. We call this new information and “evidence”.\nWhat’s happening inside your mind, that surge of heightened confidence, can once again be translated into numerical probabilities to update your initial belief. This is precisely where the Bayes comes into play.\nLet’s show how the update takes place. Let’s assign to that smile, the evidence, a probability of 80% to pass the interview.\n\n\nCode\nevidence_prob = 0.8\n# Create a range of values for the probability (x-axis)\nx = np.linspace(0, 1, 1000)\n\nevidence_distribution = stats.beta.pdf(x, 4, 2)  # Beta distribution parameters (4, 2)\nsns.lineplot(x=x, y=evidence_distribution, color='green')\nplt.title('Evidence')\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()"

    "text": "Now, let’s plug in all the information we have in the Bayesian therm we all know. We started with a not so confident prior belief (40% chance of success), then we got a new smiling evidence (80% chance of success). From here we can combine these two information and calculate our updated beliefs or as we call them “posterior beliefs”.\n\n\nCode\n# Define the parameters for the prior belief and evidence\nprior_prob = 0.4\nevidence_prob = 0.8\n\n# Create a range of values for the probability (x-axis)\nx = np.linspace(0, 1, 1000)\n\n# Calculate the prior probability distribution (prior belief)\nprior_distribution = stats.beta.pdf(x, 2, 3)  # Beta distribution parameters (2, 3)\n\n# Calculate the evidence (as a Beta distribution with parameters based on evidence probability)\nevidence_distribution = stats.beta.pdf(x, 4, 2)  # Beta distribution parameters (4, 2)\n\n# Calculate the posterior probability distribution (updated belief)\nposterior_distribution = prior_distribution * evidence_distribution\nposterior_distribution = posterior_distribution\n\n# Create a Seaborn plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.lineplot(x=x, y=prior_distribution, label='Prior Belief (40%)', color='blue')\nsns.lineplot(x=x, y=evidence_distribution, label='Evidence (80%)', color='green')\nsns.lineplot(x=x, y=posterior_distribution, label='Posterior Belief', color='red')\n\n# Customize the plot\nplt.title('Bayes update Representation')\nplt.xlabel('Probability')\nplt.ylabel('Density')\nplt.legend()\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, now you have around 60% of passing the interview. These process can keep on going with every new information you collect during the interview as in this gif.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn essence, this is the core of Bayesian updating. It allows you to adapt your beliefs based on new information as you progress through an uncertain situation, much like navigating the twists and turns of a job interview."
