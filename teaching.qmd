# Teaching Statement

> As a teacher, I aim to perpetuate knowledge and inspire learning.

## **Teaching Approach**

::: justify
As a data scientist and academic researcher, I introduce students to an array of fundamental concepts of our understanding of reality through data and always ask them to articulate their reactions and understanding of the topics by providing me, and their classmates with alternative examples and practical applications of the concepts and techniques we learned together.

My teaching approach engages students' natural creativity with a challenging mix of theory and practice. I teach theoretical concepts with a commitment to connecting these concepts with concrete real-life examples and by sharing the implications in business. For example, as the lead Data Science Instructor at Le Wagon Singapore, I taught several machine learning algorithms by explaining the implication of their use in different business and real-life contexts. I found that this approach helped students understand why, when and how to use a specific algorithm rather than another and how to articulate and justify their decision process.

## **Lecturing Approach**

::: justify
I seek a balance in my courses between lecturing to students and asking them to make discoveries. I encourage students to engage with the topic at hand, with me and with each other, in the belief that good teaching depends upon intellectual exchange. My end goal is to enable my students to envision and develop a "product" around the concepts and techniques we learned in class.

My approach to student assessment reflects my two goals. First, the students are expected to master a body of knowledge by demonstrating the practical use of different algorithms and methodologies at the end of the lecture. Second, students are given the opportunity to reflect upon the material at greater leisure and detail on project assignments.

## **Advising Approach**

::: justify
While my standards are high, I do not hesitate to help my students to meet expectations by providing office hours, review sessions and private time to discuss their concerns, fears and dreams. My approach has been to always make myself readily available to students and make it clear that if they need something then I am available at any time and point in their life to support them in their journey.

I also have a strong passion for helping students who are dedicated, but not necessarily performing well in class. In my experience, I have found some students performing far better in very applied tasks, shining in applied academic research or reaching success in business settings.

## **Teaching Interests**

::: justify
My teaching, research, and work experience has covered a wide variety of topics, including machine learning, causal machine learning, incremental machine learning, econometrics, causal inference, probabilistic modelling, time series modelling and network analysis. Given the need, I am qualified to and would readily commit the effort required to effectively teach undergraduate and graduated classes in these subjects. Because of the scope of my current research, I am specifically eager and excited to teach artificial intelligence, data science and statistics classes at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.
