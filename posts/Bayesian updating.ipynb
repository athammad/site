You don't know who the interviewers are, what to expect, or how the interview will unfold. The odds of everything going either terribly wrong or wonderfully right seem equally plausible.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the realm of probability, we can liken your state of mind to a uniform distribution, where all outcomes are equally probable. This state of not knowing what will happen or how the interview will conclude is what Bayesian terminology dubs the \"prior belief\" -- it's the starting point for your assessment.\n"
