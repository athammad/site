        "A data science boilerplate, in the context of software development and data science projects, refers to a standardized and reusable set of code, templates, libraries, and best practices that are pre-defined and organized to kickstart a data science project. It serves as a foundation or starting point for data scientists and analysts, helping them save time and effort when beginning a new project or analysis. Here's an ideal data science boilerplate that I recommend for basically any project.\n",

        "This folder structure represents a typical directory layout for a data science project. Each folder and file serves a specific purpose in organizing and managing the project's code, data, documentation, and other resources. I will now give an explanation of each item in the structure:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **data**: This folder contains the project's data files. In this case, there is a single CSV file named `data.csv`, but you can add more data files as needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Dockerfile**: This file is used to define the instructions for creating a Docker container for your project. Docker allows you to encapsulate your project environment and dependencies for consistency and portability. This is a key element for most of my projects since I love to delevope inside a Docker Container (see my other [blog post](https://athammad.github.io/site/posts/Developing%20in%20a%20Docker%20container.html) on how to use Docker with 'bind mounts'.)\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Makefile**: A Makefile contains a set of rules and commands for building, testing, and running various aspects of your project. It can automate common development tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **.env**: This file is often used to store environment variables specific to your project. These variables can include API keys, database connection strings, or other sensitive information.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **.envrc**: This file is typically used in conjunction with a tool like `direnv` to manage environment variables for your project, ensuring that the correct environment is set up when you enter the project directory.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **.gitignore**: This file specifies files and folders that should be ignored by Git when tracking changes. It helps avoid including sensitive or unnecessary files in version control.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **notebooks**: This folder is meant for Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, analysis, and documentation. In this case, there's a single notebook file named `datascientist_deliverable.ipynb`.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **README.md**: This Markdown file is used to provide an overview and documentation of the project. It typically includes project goals, setup instructions, usage examples, and other relevant information.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **requirements.txt**: This file lists the Python packages and their versions required for the project. You can use it to recreate the project's environment on another system.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **scripts**: This folder is intended for Python scripts that are part of your project. In this example, there's a single script file named `script.py`.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **setup.py**: This is a Python script used for packaging and distributing your project as a Python package and is directly related with the folder \\`thepkg\\`. It's often used when you want to share your code with others or publish it on platforms like PyPI.\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **thepkg**: This folder represents the main Python package of your project. In development phase we would install the package using the classic `pip install . e` (editablemode) to updated function without having to reinstalling it over and over again. The folder is organized in a way that follows Python package conventions:\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   **init**.py: These files indicate that the directories are Python packages and can be imported as modules.\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   **interface**: This subpackage appears to be a module for defining an interface or API for your project.\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   **ml_logic**: This subpackage seems to contain modules related to machine learning logic, including data processing (`data.py` and `preprocessor.py`) and modeling (`model.py`).\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   **params.py**: This file could contain project-specific configuration parameters or settings.\n",
        "\n",
        "    -   **utils.py**: This file likely contains utility functions or helper code used throughout the project.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, this folder structure provides a well-organized framework for a data science project, making it easier to collaborate, manage dependencies, and maintain consistency in your work.\n",
